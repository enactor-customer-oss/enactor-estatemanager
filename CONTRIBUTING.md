# Contributing to JYSK Helm charts

The OSS helm-charts project accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

## Filing issues

Filing issues on GitHub is one of the easiest ways to contribute. We value your contributions!

Before you file an issue, please search existing issues to verify the issue hasn't already been filed or resolved.

### Bug reports

When submitting a bug report, please include the following:

- Helm chart product and version you're using
- Clear steps to reproduce the issue described, if possible
- Any error message pertaining to the deployment, but no secret/sensitive information

The easier it is for us to reproduce the bug, the faster we can fix it.

### Reporting a Bug in Helm

This repository is used by Chart developers for maintaining community drive charts for internal and third party components. If your issue is in the Helm tool itself, please use the issue tracker in the [helm/helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) repository.

### Reporting a Bug in Enactor

If the bug/issue is not in relation to the helm-chart but the software itself, then the appropriate channels under that vendor/project should be used to submit a bug or seek help.
